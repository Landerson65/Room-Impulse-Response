Description: 
Real data recordings taken in different small rooms—some reverberant and others less so.
Note, due to buffering in the audio drivers of the computer used to produce the data, 
the recorded sound starts much later than it should.  The speaker and microphone are 
separated by about 5’-6’ so the delay to onset should be about 5 msec –6 msec.
